	tristate "Counter support"
	help
	  Provides Generic Counter interface support for counter devices.

	  Counter devices are prevalent within a diverse spectrum of industries.
	  The ubiquitous presence of these devices necessitates a common
	  interface and standard of interaction and exposure. This driver API
	  attempts to resolve the issue of duplicate code found among existing
	  counter device drivers by providing a generic counter interface for
	  consumption. The Generic Counter interface enables drivers to support
	  and expose a common set of components and functionality present in
	  counter devices.

config 104_QUAD_8
	tristate "ACCES 104-QUAD-8 driver"
	depends on PC104 && X86 && ISA_BUS_API && IIO
	help
	  Say yes here to build support for the ACCES 104-QUAD-8 quadrature
	  encoder counter/interface device family (104-QUAD-8, 104-QUAD-4).

	  Performing a write to a counter's IIO_CHAN_INFO_RAW sets the counter and
	  also clears the counter's respective error flag. Although the counters
	  have a 25-bit range, only the lower 24 bits may be set, either directly
	  or via a counter's preset attribute. Interrupts are not supported by
	  this driver.

	  The base port addresses for the devices may be configured via the base
	  array module parameter.

config STM32_LPTIMER_CNT
	tristate "STM32 LP Timer encoder counter driver"
	depends on (MFD_STM32_LPTIMER || COMPILE_TEST) && IIO
	help
	  Select this option to enable STM32 Low-Power Timer quadrature encoder
	  and counter driver.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the
	  module will be called stm32-lptimer-cnt.
