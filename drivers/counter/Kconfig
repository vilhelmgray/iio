	tristate "Counter support"
	help
	  Provides Generic Counter interface support for counter devices.

	  Counter devices are prevalent within a diverse spectrum of industries.
	  The ubiquitous presence of these devices necessitates a common
	  interface and standard of interaction and exposure. This driver API
	  attempts to resolve the issue of duplicate code found among existing
	  counter device drivers by providing a generic counter interface for
	  consumption. The Generic Counter interface enables drivers to support
	  and expose a common set of components and functionality present in
	  counter devices.

config 104_QUAD_8
	tristate "ACCES 104-QUAD-8 driver"
	depends on PC104 && X86 && IIO
	select ISA_BUS_API
	help
	  Say yes here to build support for the ACCES 104-QUAD-8 quadrature
	  encoder counter/interface device family (104-QUAD-8, 104-QUAD-4).

	  A counter's respective error flag may be cleared by performing a write
	  operation on the respective count value attribute. Although the
	  104-QUAD-8 counters have a 25-bit range, only the lower 24 bits may be
	  set, either directly or via the counter's preset attribute. Interrupts
	  are not supported by this driver.

	  The base port addresses for the devices may be configured via the base
	  array module parameter.

config STM32_TIMER_CNT
	tristate "STM32 Timer encoder counter driver"
	depends on MFD_STM32_TIMERS || COMPILE_TEST
	help
	  Select this option to enable STM32 Timer quadrature encoder
	  and counter driver.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the
	  module will be called stm32-timer-cnt.
