What:		/sys/bus/counter/devices/counterX/countY_count_mode
KernelVersion:	4.17
Contact:	linux-iio@vger.kernel.org
Description:
		Count mode for channel Y. The preset value for channel Y is used
		by the count mode where required. The following count modes are
		available:

		Normal:
			Counting is continuous in either direction.

		Range Limit:
			An upper or lower limit is set, mimicking limit switches
			in the mechanical counterpart. The upper limit is set to
			the preset value, while the lower limit is set to 0. The
			counter freezes at count = preset when counting up, and
			at count = 0 when counting down. At either of these
			limits, the counting is resumed only when the count
			direction is reversed.

		Non-recycle:
			Counter is disabled whenever a 24-bit count overflow or
			underflow takes place. The counter is re-enabled when a
			new count value is loaded to the counter via a preset
			operation or write to raw.

		Modulo-N:
			A count boundary is set between 0 and the preset value.
			The counter is reset to 0 at count = preset when
			counting up, while the counter is set to the preset
			value at count = 0 when counting down; the counter does
			not freeze at the bundary points, but counts
			continuously throughout.

What:		/sys/bus/counter/devices/counterX/countY_direction
KernelVersion:	4.17
Contact:	linux-iio@vger.kernel.org
Description:
		Read-only attribute that indicates the count direction of
		Count Y. Two count directions are available: Forward and
		Backward.

What:		/sys/bus/counter/devices/counterX/countY_enable
KernelVersion:	4.17
Contact:	linux-iio@vger.kernel.org
Description:
		Whether channel Y inputs A and B are enabled. Valid attribute
		values are boolean.

What:		/sys/bus/counter/devices/counterX/countY_noise_error
KernelVersion:	4.17
Contact:	linux-iio@vger.kernel.org
Description:
		Read-only attribute that indicates whether excessive noise is
		present at the channel Y count inputs in quadrature clock mode;
		irrelevant in non-quadrature (Pulse-Direction) clock mode.

What:		/sys/bus/counter/devices/counterX/countY_preset
KernelVersion:	4.17
Contact:	linux-iio@vger.kernel.org
Description:
		If the counter device supports preset registers, the preset
		count for channel Y is provided by this attribute.

What:		/sys/bus/counter/devices/counterX/countY_preset_enable
KernelVersion:	4.17
Contact:	linux-iio@vger.kernel.org
Description:
		Whether to set channel Y counter with channel Y preset value
		when channel Y index input is active, or continuously count.
		Valid attribute values are boolean.

Description:
		Active level of channel Y-16 index input; irrelevant in
		non-synchronous load mode.

		configuration are listed in this file.

What:		/sys/bus/counter/devices/counterX/signalY_synchronous_mode
KernelVersion:	4.17
Contact:	linux-iio@vger.kernel.org
Description:
		Configure channel Y-16 counter for non-synchronous or
		synchronous load mode. Synchronous load mode cannot be selected
		in non-quadrature (Pulse-Direction) clock mode.

		Non-synchronous:
			A logic low level is the active level at this index
			input. The index function (as enabled via preset_enable)
			is performed directly on the active level of the index
			input.

		Synchronous:
			Intended for interfacing with encoder Index output in
			quadrature clock mode. The active level is configured
			via index_polarity. The index function (as enabled via
			preset_enable) is performed synchronously with the
			quadrature clock on the active level of the index input.
