KernelVersion:	4.17
Contact:	linux-iio@vger.kernel.org
Description:
		Count data of Count Y. The following data types are available:

		COUNT_POSITION_UNSIGNED:
			Unsigned integer value representing position.

		COUNT_POSITION_SIGNED:
			Signed integer value representing position.

What:		/sys/bus/counter/devices/counterX/countY_function
KernelVersion:	4.17
Contact:	linux-iio@vger.kernel.org
Description:
		Count function mode of Count Y; count function evaluation is
		triggered by conditions specified by the countY_signalZ_action
		attributes. The following count functions are available:

		Increase:
			Accumulated count is incremented.

		Decrease:
			Accumulated count is decremented.

		Pulse-Direction:
			Rising edges on quadrature pair signal A updates the
			respective count. The input level of quadrature pair
			signal B determines direction.

		Quadrature x1:
			If direction is forward, rising edges on quadrature pair
			signal A updates the respective count; if the direction
			is backward, falling edges on quadrature pair signal A
			updates the respective count. Quadrature encoding
			determines the direction.

		Quadrature x2:
			Any state transition on quadrature pair signal A updates
			the respective count. Quadrature encoding determines the
			direction.

		Quadrature x4:
			Any state transition on either quadrature pair signals
			updates	the respective count. Quadrature encoding
			determines the direction.

KernelVersion:	4.17
Contact:	linux-iio@vger.kernel.org
Description:
		Action mode of Count Y for Signal Z. This attribute indicates
		the condition of Signal Z that triggers the count function
		evaluation for Count Y. The following action modes are
		available:

		None:
			Signal does not trigger the count function. In
			Pulse-Direction count function mode, this Signal is
			evaluated as Direction.

		Rising Edge:
			Low state transitions to high state.

		Falling Edge:
			High state transitions to low state.

		Both Edges:
			Any state transition.
