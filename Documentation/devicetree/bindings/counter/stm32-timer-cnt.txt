STMicroelectronics STM32 Timer quadrature encoder

STM32 Timer provides quadrature encoder counter mode to detect
angular position and direction of rotary elements,
from IN1 and IN2 input signals.

Must be a sub-node of an STM32 Timer device tree node.
See ../mfd/stm32-timers.txt for details about the parent node.

Required properties:
- compatible:		Must be "st,stm32-timer-counter".
- pinctrl-names: 	Set to "default".
- pinctrl-0: 		List of phandles pointing to pin configuration nodes,
			to set IN1/IN2 pins in mode of operation for Low-Power
			Timer input on external pin.

Example:
	timers@40010000  {
		compatible = "st,stm32-timers";
		...
		counter {
			compatible = "st,stm32-timer-counter";
			pinctrl-names = "default";
			pinctrl-0 = <&tim1_in_pins>;
		};
	};
